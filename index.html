                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I am currently a third-year Computer Science student at the University of British Columbia. Prior to my current degree, I completed a Bachelor of Science with a major in biology. My first degree inspired my fascination with technology and led me to transition into the field of computer science.

  I have completed projects in Racket and Java during my educational career and have experimented with HTML, CSS, and Javascript for my own personal projects.<br><br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During my time off work, I enjoy travelling and having the opportunity to experience new cultures and develop relationships with people across the globe. I also enjoy giving back to my community and participating in various on and off-campus activities such as sports challenges, hackathons, and volunteer opportunities. I will
  leave you with my favourite video from my travels so far; it's a video of me jumping off a waterfall in Croatia last summer!
