              transfer using a secondary passive connection strictly for data

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am a recently graduated Computer
              Science student from the University of British Columbia. Prior to
              my current degree, I completed a Bachelor of Science with a major
              in biology. My first degree fed my fascination for technology and
              led me to transition into the field of computer science. I have
              completed projects in Java, C, and Typescript during my
              educational career and have experimented with HTML, CSS,
              Javascript, and React for my personal projects.<br /><br />

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During my time off work, I enjoy
              travelling and having the opportunity to experience new cultures
              and develop relationships with people across the globe. I also
              enjoy giving back to my community and participating in various on
              and off-campus activities such as sports challenges, hackathons,
              and volunteer opportunities. I will leave you with my favourite
              video from my travels so far; it's a video of me jumping off a
              waterfall in Croatia!
